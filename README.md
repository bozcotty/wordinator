# Wordinator

Wordinator is a simple Sinatra API that compares two words.
Enter two words in the url and a JSON response is returned, notifying you if the two words you entered are anagrams.

### Under the Hood
- you'll find a shotgun gem required in the gemfile
- along with some other sinatra gems

### To Get Going

- clone from github
- bundle install
- execution=> $ shotgun wordinator.rb
- view in browser on localhost:9393

### What's an Anagram?

An anagram is made when one word is made by rearranging the letters of another word.

Find out if Word Two is an anagram of Word One (or visa versa). Enter two words, hit submit, and get the results!
